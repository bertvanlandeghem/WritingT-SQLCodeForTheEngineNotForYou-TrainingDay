# "Yesterday was faster - today is slow"

## Scenario

On a lovely morning, a user reaches you in panic because some query that runs multiple times a day was fast yesterday but today is slower.
You do your diligences and ask the user questions like:

- What is fast and slow?
- Was there any code change?
- Can you trigger a call right now if needed?

The answers to these questions will vary a lot from user to user. ðŸ˜…

## Identify

In this demo let's assume the user can press a button that triggers the [query](02-ChangedVersion.sql).  
This will be a good opportunity to use `sp_WhoIsActive` to check what's running.

After catching the query that is running (remember that you can filter by database/login/hostname/program to narrow down the sessions), you find the [query](02-ChangedVersion.sql).  
When you asked the developer if there was any change on this query - maybe a new release last night - the answer is: "Yes".

### How can we identify the older query?

Here we are assuming that `Query Store` is turned on in "Read/Write" mode and therefore collecting what's running.  
In this case we can leverage on `Query Store` to search by our query and try to find both versions.

We could find at least 2 entries [yesterday's query](01-Original.sql) version and the [today's query](02-ChangedVersion.sql).

## Analysis

Just by looking into the code you can clearly see there are more variables and mode code.  
But what happened between both versions? Copy & paste and replace with new parameters/values.

### Why is that bad?

To answer that question, we need to check what is the plan shape of both executions.  
By doing that you will find that for each `EXISTS` there is a `SCAN` on the `Posts` table. That means when we add another couple of `EXISTS` the number of scans will increase.
Hence the slowness of the newer version.

## Rewrite Suggestion

When you find examples like this, take an extra minute to check if will make sense rewrite the query instead of just append a couple of lines of code to cross the finish line.

This is what I call the "Copy & Paste problem". The developer "just" needs to copy some code pattern and replace one or two things. However, that 30 seconds change costs a lots of time/resources and decrease performance.

### What could we do better?

If we take a couple of minutes to analyze the query pattern, we may be able to rewrite the query in a better way and with that, make it run faster.

Check the [improved version](03-ImprovedVersion.sql) with my suggestion for this scenario.

## Comparing results

Run the [04-ComparingSideBySide.sql](04-ComparingSideBySide.sql) query and compare not only the `IO` metrics but also `CPU time` and `elapsed time` (on `Message` tab) but also the execution plans.
