# sp_WhoIsActive other options

I use it to find queries, based not only but mainly on:

* WaitTypes
* GetPlans
* Blocking (@find_block_leaders)
* Get locks (@get_locks)
* Show Sleeping Spids (with open transactions)
* To sample activity (delta_interval)
* To check if query is slower than usual (@get_avg_time)
* Filter by session/login/host/program/database
* Get transactional info
* Get memory info
* Check isolation level
* Save data to a table to analyze.
